    <p>Many of Schwarzenbach's lyrics were rooted in his specific concerns, often lifted directly from his journal.</p> 
    <p>This focus on <em>personal, immediate matters</em>, coupled with <em>imagery and word choices</em>, attracted 
        listeners to Schwarzenbach and made him a cult idol in rock and roll circles.</p>
